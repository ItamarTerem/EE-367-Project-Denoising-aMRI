% If different channels have different PSDs, they can be passed

% y_est = BM3D(z, cat(3, PSD1, PSD2));

% To include refiltering:
% y_est = BM3D(z, PSD, 'refilter');

% For other settings, use BM3DProfile.
% profile = BM3DProfile(); % equivalent to profile = BM3DProfile('np');
% profile.gamma = 6;  % redefine value of gamma parameter
% y_est = BM3D(z, PSD, profile);

% Note: For white noise, you may instead of the PSD 
% also pass a standard deviation 
% y_est = BM3D(z, sqrt(noise_var));
% or multiple standard deviations
% y_est = BM3D(z, [sigma1, sigma2]);


%psnr = getPSNR(y, y_est)

% PSNR ignoring 16-pixel wide borders (as used in the paper), due to refiltering potentially leaving artifacts
% on the pixels near the boundary of the image when noise is not circulant
